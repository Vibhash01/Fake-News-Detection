📰 Fake News Detection Model
A Machine Learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

-> 📌 Features
✅ Preprocesses text (removes stopwords, punctuations, etc.)
✅ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text transformation
✅ Trains a Logistic Regression model for classification
✅ Provides accuracy evaluation using Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and ROC Curve
✅ Allows real-time Fake News Prediction
✅ Model can be saved and reloaded for future use


-> 📰 Fake News Detection Model - Summary
In today's digital world, fake news spreads rapidly and can mislead people. This project aims to automatically detect fake news using Machine Learning.

-> 📌 What does this model do?
It analyzes news articles and predicts whether they are real or fake.
It uses a text-processing technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to understand the importance of words in a news article.
It then trains a Logistic Regression model to classify the news as either real or fake based on patterns in the text.

-> 🔍 How does it work?
Data Collection – The model is trained using a dataset of real and fake news articles.
Preprocessing – It cleans the text by removing unnecessary words, symbols, and stopwords.
Feature Extraction – The text is converted into numerical values using TF-IDF.
Model Training – A Logistic Regression algorithm learns from the data and recognizes fake news patterns.
Prediction – When you input a new news article, the model predicts if it is real or fake.

-> 📊 How accurate is it?
The model achieves around 94% accuracy, meaning it correctly identifies fake news in most cases. It also provides detailed performance metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to measure its reliability.


-> 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled news articles with:

text → The news article content
label → 1 (Real News) | 0 (Fake News)
Dataset Source: Kaggle - Fake News Dataset
